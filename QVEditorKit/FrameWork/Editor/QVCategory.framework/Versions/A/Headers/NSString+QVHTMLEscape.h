/// Get a string where internal characters that need escaping for HTML are escaped

///  For example, '&' become '&amp;'. This will only cover characters from table
///  A.2.2 of http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/dtds.html#a_dtd_Special_characters
///  which is what you want for a unicode encoded webpage. If you have a ascii
///  or non-encoded webpage, please use stringByEscapingAsciiHTML which will
///  encode all characters.
///
/// For obvious reasons this call is only safe once.

/// Get a string where internal characters that need escaping for HTML are escaped
//
///  For example, '&' become '&amp;'
///  All non-mapped characters (unicode that don't have a &keyword; mapping)
///  will be converted to the appropriate &#xxx; value. If your webpage is
///  unicode encoded (UTF16 or UTF8) use stringByEscapingHTML instead as it is
///  faster, and produces less bloated and more readable HTML (as long as you
///  are using a unicode compliant HTML reader).
